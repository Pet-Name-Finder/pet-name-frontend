## Reflections / Lessons Learned
* Gained a more solid understanding of GraphQL, `git rebase`, and CircleCI
* Connecting front end + back end early in a simple fashion can help save time later on
* When on a time crunch: focus on an MVP and build out additional features if time allows

## Possible Future Extensions
* Forming "Packs" with other users to determine mutually-liked names
* Choosing from lists of names based on gender, pet-type (cat/dog), or other factors
* Authentication through OAuth or other means
* A mobile app built with React Native
